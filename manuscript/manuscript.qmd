## Introduction

<!-- high level connecting wildfire to climate change; mitigation is not enough -->

Changing climate is driving longer and more intense fire seasons. There is an urgent need to reduce wildfire risk in fire-prone regions of the US. Yet, the primary method for reducing risk involves the costly removal of combustible fuels. Despite significant progress, the number of acres in need of treatment is very large and not expected to be treated over the next decade. Wildfire suppression and response currently does and will continue to play an important role in protecting people, property, and other valued assets from wildfire.

<!-- aviation is an important response asset but expensive -->

Wildfire response is a coordinated effort between federal, state, and local land management agencies. Aviation resources have been used in wildfire response since WWII [@pyne1982], and represent an important yet expensive firefighting resource. Helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft are used to drop water and retardant on or in advance of the fire. Aircraft are also used to gather information about the extent and intensity of the fire, and to survey damage. While aviation can provide valuable services, they are one of the most expensive resources on an active fire.

<!-- aviation expense -->

Over the past 10 years, the federal government spent an average of \$2.3 billion per year on wildfire suppression [@suppress]. Approximately 21% (\$493 million) of that is spent on aviation resources [@stonesifer2021]. These costs involve hourly flight costs to operate the aircraft, the cost of retardant, and the cost to keep aircraft available. Given the high cost of aviation, it is critical to determine whether the benefits exceed the costs. Otherwise, resources could be better invested in other firefighting resources such as wildland firefighting engines, dozers, and personnel.

Until 2008?, federal agencies owned and operated a fleet of aircraft bearing the cost of maintenance. Since 2008 (check this), the aircraft are owned by private entities and contracted for use by federal agencies. Contracts are either exclusive use or call-when-needed where the name dictates the structure of the contract and the associated costs. Exclusive use contracts mandate that an aircraft is exclusively available to the contracting entity (e.g., US Forest Service) for a specified number of days. Call-when-needed contracts specify that an aircraft is available for a short period of time (e.g., 3 days) at a daily availability rate. The optimal structure, cost, and duration of contracts is an economics problem.

<!-- objectives  -->

The objective of this paper is to describe/investigate the economic aspects of aviation used for wildfire response. First, we will discuss the lack of objective measurement of the benefits of aviation that is necessary to subject their use to benefit cost analysis. Second, we will apply economic principles/theory to the procurement of aviation resources. While this paper will not analyze data or come to clear conclusions about the use of aviation, it will frame the economic problems and provide a path forward for how to solve them.

# Measuring the benefits of aviation

Cost benefit analysis requires the accounting of the costs and benefits of an intervention over a relevant time period (cite). The cost of using aviation to fight fire is known because the government must pay the bill. The benefits are harder to quantify because they involve the avoided costs and losses of fires that were prevented from growing. If aviation resources reduce the probability that a fire spreads and damages property, we don't observe the counterfactual - what would have happened in the absence of aviation use. A more nuanced challenge is that aviation is not allocated randomly, but rather assigned to fires that decision maker's believe resources will have the best chance to affect fire outcomes. This section describes how aviation resources are currently used to fight fire, discusses the conceptual challenges to measuring benefits, and proposes data driven approaches to measuring the benefits of aviation given currently available data.

Aviation resources such as large airtankers (LAT) are believed to be most effective during the initial attack phase (the first burning period which is usually from ignition to 10:00 AM the following day). The logic is simple, aggressively attack the fire while it is small. Most fires (more than 90%) are contained during initial attack. However, the fires that do escape initial containment because of weather or lack of sufficient IA effort can grow large and pose risk to values at risk. Aviation is increasingly used to support extend attack.

Procurement

The USFS determined that owning and maintaining its own fleet of aircraft is not worth the cost. In xxxx, they changed to a procurement model in which private firefighting aircraft are contracted for a period of time at a specified cost.

Describe "exclusive use" and "call when needed" contracts

The interesting economics question is how many of each aircraft to sign under each type of contract?

What are the key determinants of this optimal portfolio of contracts
